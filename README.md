### control: WSAD

**The heart of the project:**
Object-oriented programming

**Project describe:**
My first, simple game based on the MDM JavaScript course (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Adding_bouncing_balls_features). The white 'evil circle' must catch every balls - then game is over. Game control: WSAD.


**Project objective:**
To test comprehension of JavaScript objects and object-oriented constructs and  to get some practice with using objects and object-oriented techniques in a real world context.
