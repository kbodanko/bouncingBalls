### control: WSAD

**The heart of the project:**
Object-oriented programming

**Project describe:**
My first, simple game based on the MDN JavaScript course (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Adding_bouncing_balls_features). The white 'evil circle' must catch each of 30 balls - then game is won. Game control: WSAD. The game uses the https://sweetalert.js.org/ library for nice modals with alerts. Also has a ball counter.

**Project objective:**
To test comprehension of JavaScript objects and object-oriented constructs and  to get some practice with using objects and object-oriented techniques in a real world context.

**I learned and/or practised while writing the project:**
- use the DOM and manipulate elements
- use the random function
- create classes and constructors
- use the canvas
- logical thinking (how to move the ball?)
